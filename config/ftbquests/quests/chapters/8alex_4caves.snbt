				"If a Magnetic Quarry Smasher is placed in a square or rectangular area marked with Magnetic Lights and a Magnetic Quarry, the quarry smasher will automatically activate. White electricity will begin to dart between each light and the smasher, and it will start flying toward the most north-western corner of the marked area."
				""
				"Once reaching this corner, the smasher will then release its scarlet neodymium weight down to the first solid block below; crushing it in an instant if it isn't a barrier, bedrock, command block, jigsaw block, reinforced deepslate, structure block, or Volcanic Core. If the block below is one of the aforementioned indestructible blocks, the scarlet neodymium weight will simply ignore and phase through it. After breaking the block below itself, it will move one block south and crush the new block below it. This process will keep repeating until it finds itself at a boundary of the marked area, which it will then fly back north and one block adjacent to start a new row of blocks to destroy. After an entire one block deep layer of blocks have been destroyed, it will return to its original starting position and begin mining the layer directly underneath."
				""
				"This entire process will keep on repeating itself until the Magnetic Quarry Smasher finishes mining every single mineable block in its marked area, which it will then lay dormant on the ground once reaching this point."

Every 10 damage a Submarine absorbs, it will advance one stage in cracking around its main hull, propellors and window. These cracks will keep on getting worse as more stages of damage are advanced through, eventually becoming so severe after three stages that it will fall into full disrepair - instantly kicking out its passenger and losing its left propeller in the process. If being driven through water before becoming this unusable state, it will rapidly sink to the seafloor. After 4 stages of fracturing, and a total of 50 damage has been absorbed, the Submarine will fully break and drop 2-3 copper ingots."
